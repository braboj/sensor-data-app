### Senior Fullstack Software Engineer Homework Assignment

#### Overview:
As part of the selection process for the Senior Fullstack Software Engineer 
position at Heidelberg Materials, we ask you to complete a practical homework 
assignment. This assignment is designed to assess your in-depth knowledge of 
Python and your ability to work with Angular. You will develop a 
mini-application that simulates some of the functionalities related to our 
digital transformation efforts in the cement production industry.

#### Objective:
Create a Python-based backend and an Angular frontend application that:
1. **Collects simulated sensor data** from an industrial plant.
2. **Forwards this data** to a frontend where it can be displayed and monitored.
3. **Allows users to create customized dashboards** to visualize the data.

#### Requirements:
1. **Backend (Python):**
    - Develop a Python application that generates simulated sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, vibration) every 10 seconds.
    - Implement an API using a Python framework (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) to send this data to the frontend.
    - Store the sensor data in a PostgreSQL database.

2. **Frontend (Angular):**
    - Create an Angular application that displays the sensor data in real-time.
    - Utilize frameworks/libraries such as Grafana to create visual representations of the data.
    - Implement functionality that allows users to select which data points (e.g., temperature, humidity) they want to visualize in their dashboard.
    - Ensure the user interface is clean and user-friendly.

3. **Integration and Testing:**
    - Ensure that the backend and frontend are fully integrated and can operate in a seamless manner.
    - Write unit tests for both the backend and frontend to ensure functionality.
    - Document the setup process and how the system operates.
    - Use Docker for easy deployment and testing of the application.

4. **Extra Features (Nice to have):**
    - Implement login functionality with user authentication and authorization.
    - Add the ability to save custom dashboards.

#### Submission:
- Your code should be pushed to a git repository. This git repository should be submitted with full history.
- Include a README file with the repository explaining how to setup and run the applications, and any other necessary documentation.
- Provide a brief explanation of the design choices and technologies used, as well as any challenges faced during the development process.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Correctness:** The application works as described.
- **Code quality:** Your code should be clean, well-documented, and easy to read.
- **Design:** The architecture of the solution should be logical and well thought out.
- **Problem-solving:** Innovation and efficiency in how problems are approached and solved.

#### Deadline:
Please complete and submit your assignment within 1 week from the receipt of this document. You should spend 4-8 hours on completing the task, not more.

# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

1. First, read these guidelines. Before you begin making changes, state your 
intent to do so in an Issue. 
2. Then, fork the project. Make changes in your copy of the repository. Then open a pull request 
   once your changes are ready.
3. A discussion about your change will follow, and if accepted, your contribution
will be incorporated into the project codebase.

## Commit messages

For commit messages without an issue, use the following format:

```
[#####] - Commit message
```

If the commit is related to an issue, use the following format:

```
(#NNN) - Commit message
```

Where `NNN` is the issue number generated by GitHub.


## Release

Each release of the project is managed by the project maintainers. A release
is made by creating a tag in the repository. 

The release system is defined as following:
   - `[#####] - Tag A.B.C.D`.

The meaning of the version number is as follows:

- A: Major version: Incremented for incompatible API changes.
- B: Minor version: Incremented for new features that are backwards-compatible.
- C: Build: Incremented for pre-release versions of the software.
- D: Patch: Incremented for bug fixes that are backwards-compatible.
